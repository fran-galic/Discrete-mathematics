# Discrete Mathematics - Graph Theory and Recursive Relations

This repository contains programming tasks and solutions from the **"Discrete Mathematics"** course, with a focus on **Graph Theory and Recursive Relations**. The primary aim is to solve advanced problems in discrete mathematics using algorithmic approaches and programming techniques.

## Course Overview

The course covers:
- Homogeneous and non-homogeneous linear recursive relations.
- Basic concepts of graph theory, including connectivity, trees, planarity, and graph coloring.
- Optimization algorithms on graphs, directed graphs, and matchings.
- Recursive problem-solving approaches applied to combinatorial problems.

Although the course is titled **"Discrete Mathematics"**, a significant portion is dedicated to understanding and applying graph theory and recursion in solving engineering problems algorithmically.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing the programming tasks in this repository, I have learned to:
- Solve homogeneous and non-homogeneous linear recursions.
- Apply recursive thinking to combinatorial problems.
- Understand and work with fundamental graph theory concepts.
- Solve real-world problems using graph theory principles.
- Approach complex problems algorithmically and implement solutions using programming.

## Structure

### Lectures:
Weekly lectures (4 hours) cover theoretical foundations of recursive relations and graph theory, providing the mathematical background needed for solving practical problems.

### Independent Tasks:
During the semester, three programming tasks are assigned, where I applied algorithmic techniques to solve complex problems from discrete mathematics, particularly in recursive relations and graph theory. These tasks form the core of the laboratory exercises.

### Laboratory:
In the lab sessions, I wrote, tested, and optimized programs that implemented solutions for recursive and graph-based problems. The focus was on understanding the efficiency and correctness of algorithms.
